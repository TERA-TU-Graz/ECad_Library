# Sources for footpritns and symbols lib.

Most symbols and footprints are either directly taken from the [official
Kicad library](https://github.com/KiCad) (and modified to fit the convention of this project)
or generated via the [footprint generator scripts](https://github.com/pointhi/kicad-footprint-generator).

For this reason the footprints and symbols are under GPLv2

# Sources for 3d models.

Most [3d models are script generated](https://github.com/easyw/kicad-3d-models-in-freecad). (using the same generators as the official kicad lib)
Some models are created directly with freecad.

The more useful models have been shared with the [official packages3d lib](https://github.com/KiCad/packages3D/) of kicad. For this reason they are under GPLv2 with the "symbol exception".
